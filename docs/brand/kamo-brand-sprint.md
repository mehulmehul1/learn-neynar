## Block 1 — Foundations (~45 min)

1) What, How, Why (Golden Circle)
- What (1 sentence): Kamo is an onchain mini app to create posts, save drafts, and schedule them for Farcaster and Zora, connected to a user’s social crypto account.
- How (1–2 sentences, differentiators/process): A simple mobile UX that runs inside a Farcaster client or the Base app. Users seamlessly log in with their wallet, compose content (text, image, video), and schedule posting; Kamo orchestrates Zora coin posts (transactions) through a streamlined interface. Roadmap includes optional web2 scheduling bridges and an Instagram/TikTok‑level editor.
- Why (purpose/belief, 1 sentence): Help creators publish more, earn more, and connect web3 social (Zora, Base, Farcaster) with familiar creation flows—removing friction so great content ships consistently.

2) 20‑Year Roadmap (time horizons)
- 0–3 years (Now): Launch MVP scheduling to Farcaster and Zora; refine UX; add powerful yet simple mobile editor; iterate on viral loop and growth.
- 3–10 years (Next): Expand channels (select web2 bridges), deepen onchain identity/monetization features, automation/AI tooling for creators, session keys/gas strategies.
- 10–20 years (Later): Become the default onchain creator suite spanning social, commerce, and programmable media with interoperable identities and assets.

3) Top Audiences (Ranked)
1. Farcaster/Zora creators & power users (primary)
2. Emerging onchain creators exploring monetized posts
3. Community managers / brand storytellers on Base
- Key jobs-to-be-done (each): Publish quickly; schedule consistently; monetize via Zora coins; maintain brand/voice; measure impact.

4) Competitive Landscape (Top 3 — draft categories)
1. Native composers (Farcaster/Zora) — same: posting; different: Kamo adds cross‑channel scheduling, coin flow orchestration.
2. Generic schedulers (web2 tools) — same: scheduling; different: onchain identities, Zora coin tx handling, Base Mini App UX.
3. Creator editing apps — same: content creation; different: integrated onchain posting + monetization + identity.

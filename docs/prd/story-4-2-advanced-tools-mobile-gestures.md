# Story 4.2 Advanced Tools & Mobile Gestures

As a mobile-first creator,
I want powerful editing tools and natural gestures,
so that I can prepare media without leaving the app.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Enable advanced crop ratios, text styles, stickers, brush presets, and filters per integration guide.
2: Implement multi-touch gestures (pinch zoom, two-finger rotate, swipe tool change) using pointer events/Hammer.js.
3: Provide haptic feedback (Capacitor/Vibration API) on key actions, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion` and battery saver signals.
4: Surface before/after toggle and reset zoom for accessibility.

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Manual testing on device matrix validates gestures and responsiveness.
- IV2: Performance profiling shows frame rate within acceptable range; no jank >16ms sustained.
- IV3: Accessibility review ensures toolbar keyboard control and descriptive labels.

## Notes
- Document stretch goal for perspective correction if time permits.
- Cache sticker packs/icons for offline use.

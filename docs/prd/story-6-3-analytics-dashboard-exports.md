# Story 6.3 Analytics Dashboard & Exports

As a data-driven creator,
I want dashboards and export options,
so that I can analyze performance and share results externally.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Build analytics dashboard with charts for performance trends, ROI, streak tracking, challenge participation, and reminder efficacy.
2: Implement CSV export and API token generation for external analysis.
3: Integrate feature flags for experimentation (social proof variants) with reporting on impact.
4: Provide accessibility alternatives for charts (summaries, table views).

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Analytics events populate dashboard; data validated against sample dataset.
- IV2: Exports include correct schema and respect permissions.
- IV3: API token flow secure (scoped, revocable, audit logged).

## Notes
- Coordinate with growth/analytics teams on metric definitions.
- Ensure exports sanitized (no PII beyond necessary identifiers).

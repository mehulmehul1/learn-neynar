# Story 6.4 Success & Share Loop Enhancements

As a growth marketer,
I want success screens to drive share and re-engagement,
so that creators amplify their wins and return.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Design success sheet with dynamic share card preview, recommended friend mentions, and downstream CTAs (queue next, open portfolio).
2: Integrate challenge badges, streak progress, and reminder opt-ins with accessible messaging.
3: Track share adoption, CTA clicks, and retention metrics via analytics events (`success_share.click`, `success_share.reminder_opt_in`).
4: Provide A/B testing hooks for copy, layout, and CTA sequencing.

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Success flow tested across coin/cast combinations; share adoption logged.
- IV2: Notifications/reminder preferences updated in settings.
- IV3: Experiment framework toggles variants and logs exposures.

## Notes
- Ensure share card render meets template performance targets.
- Collaborate with UX for celebratory motion that respects accessibility.

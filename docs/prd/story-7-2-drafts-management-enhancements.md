# Story 7.2 Drafts Management Enhancements

As a power user,
I want advanced drafts management,
so that I can organize, bulk manage, and resolve conflicts efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Build drafts dashboard with filters (status, template, scheduled), bulk actions (delete, archive, export), and offline indicators.
2: Implement conflict badges and quick diff view for drafts updated elsewhere.
3: Allow bulk cleanup prompts when storage nearing limit, with educational messaging.
4: Integrate analytics (`drafts.bulk_action`, `drafts.conflict_view`) and capture outcome.

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Offline scenarios tested (airplane mode) with queued actions syncing on reconnect.
- IV2: Accessibility ensures table/list navigable with keyboard and screen reader.
- IV3: Storage warnings triggered via controlled test (IndexedDB quota).

## Notes
- tie into Story 2.5 conflict resolution components.
- Provide support doc link for storage troubleshooting.

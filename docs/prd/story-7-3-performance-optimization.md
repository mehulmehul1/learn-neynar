# Story 7.3 Performance Optimization & Bundle Tuning

As a performance engineer,
I want to finalize bundle optimizations and runtime tuning,
so that the app meets mobile TTI <3s and interaction budgets at launch.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and prefetch strategies for heavy editors and analytics modules.
2: Optimize React Query caching/invalidations to avoid redundant requests.
3: Profile and remediate main-thread hotspots (e.g., large JSON parsing, expensive renders) keeping interactions <100ms.
4: Document performance playbook and freeze budgets; integrate final metrics into monitoring dashboards.

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Lighthouse and WebPageTest runs meet targets across device matrix.
- IV2: Web Vitals dashboard shows green zones for LCP, INP, CLS.
- IV3: Regression tests confirm no functionality loss after code splitting.

## Notes
- Collaborate with backend on caching to reduce latency.
- Ensure service worker/offline caching strategy documented if used.

# Story 7.4 Accessibility & Usability Sign-off

As a release manager,
I want final accessibility and usability validation,
so that we ship confidently and meet launch commitments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Conduct full WCAG 2.1 AA audit (manual + automated) across all journeys; remediate blockers and document exceptions.
2: Run usability study (8-10 creators) achieving SUS >=80 and time-on-task benchmarks; capture findings and fixes.
3: Finalize QA regression suite (automated + manual) covering critical flows with sign-offs from QA and product.
4: Compile launch readiness report summarizing metrics, risks, mitigation, and go/no-go recommendation.

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Accessibility audit artifacts stored in repo/docs; issues tracked to closure.
- IV2: Usability results documented with follow-up tasks created.
- IV3: Launch readiness review sign-off recorded with stakeholders.

## Notes
- Coordinate with QA agent for gatekeeping.
- Provide fallback plan if any metric falls short (follow-up epics or rollbacks).
